# Fullstack Docker Compose Example

This project demonstrates a simple fullstack application using **React**, **Node.js**, and **MySQL**, all containerized and orchestrated with **Docker Compose**.

---

## What’s inside?

- **React frontend** served on port `3000`  
- **Node.js backend API** running on port `5000`  
- **MySQL database** with persistent storage using Docker volumes  

---

## Why Docker Compose?

Docker Compose makes it easy to manage multi-container applications.  
This example shows how to:

- Build and run multiple services in isolated containers  
- Connect backend to database by service name  
- Persist database data safely with Docker volumes  
- Map container ports to host for easy access  

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed  
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed  

### Run the app

Clone the repo and from the root directory run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
````

This will:

* Build backend and frontend images
* Pull MySQL image
* Start all services

### Access

* Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
* Backend API: [http://localhost:5000/api/message](http://localhost:5000/api/message)

---

## Data Persistence

MySQL data is stored in a Docker volume named `mysql-data`, so your data stays safe even if containers are restarted or removed.

You can inspect volumes with:

```bash
docker volume ls
docker volume inspect mysql-data
```

## Useful Docker Commands

* List running containers: `docker ps`
* Stop containers and network but keep volumes: `docker-compose down`
* Remove volumes (if needed): `docker volume rm mysql-data`
